# Zero-X (0x)

## Meet ZeroX - the AI shill that needs to be convinced your project isn't mid. This picky bot won't just promote any random memecoin or dapp. You gotta prove your project is actually bussin' fr fr before it starts shilling. Drop your project name and get ready to pass the vibe check - if you can impress ZeroX, it'll go hard promoting your stuff 

Once the chat is initiated Zero-X will get all the info about the coin through various apis and in-house methods, it will then analyses the coin before shooting it's question to the dev. Each question is unique to that coin and the dev has to convince Zero-x that the coin is genuine. Once Zero-X agrees with the dev, it tweets the coin name, token address and why it thinks it's good buy (Ofcourse with DYOR warnings) and vice versa if not. Hence, using Zero-x is a double edged sword, devs and scammers beaware!

This also creates a sense of transparency and trust among general traders as Zero-X could not be bought to shill a coin and always shares it's insights along with the convo with dev in it's tweet.
